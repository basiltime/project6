HOT TAKES
==========
In this project, I've built the back end for a hot sauce review site using NodeJs, Express, and MongoDB. Users are able to create a new sauce and add it to the database. The creator of the sauce then has access to modify and delete their entry. Users can also like and dislike any sauce on the site.
